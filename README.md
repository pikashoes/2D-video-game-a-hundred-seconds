<h2> University of Chicago: MPCS 51036 Final Project </h2>

Title: 100 Seconds To Live
--------------------------
Instructions were to create a multi-threaded game that extended basic base code (a single spaceship, asteroids with limited physics, and sound effects) proivded. "The game-engine is flexible and highly extendable, and you may create a wide variety of arcade-style 2D games such as Asteroids, Missile Command, 1941, etc."

My Game
-------
Use WASD to move around:
* W: Up
* A: Left
* S: Right
* D: Down
* Space: Shoot

There are three characters to choose from, each with different speeds and missiles. I created an original game (I chose not to replicate an existing game) dedicated to my aunt, who recently passed away. The game features different endings, as well as an Easter egg. As your characters moves around, you can choose to pick up objects that represent four basic parts of life, and you can choose to absorb, kill, or ignore the "skulls", which represent the poisons in your life.

Depending on your choices, you get a different ending.

> ~30 different endings
> 3 characters
> 4 pick-up items
> 1 skull

The game also features a constantly scrolling background, added sound effects, art, and music.
